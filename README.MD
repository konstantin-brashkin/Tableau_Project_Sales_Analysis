# Introduction

Hi! This is my **Tableau Portfolio Project** which involves working with SuperStore Sales🛒 Dataset.  
This project includes steps such as **Joining tables** together, **creating Calculated fields**, **creating Map chart** 🌍,
**Bar chart**📊, **Scatter plot** ● and **Line Area Chart**📈, and the final step is to combine all the visualizations into one
**Dashboard**!

You can download the actual **Tableau Packaged Workbook** from this repository or directly by this link: [Sales Analysis Tableau Project.twbx](/Sales%20Analysis%20Tableau%20Project.twbx/)  
Also here is the dataset I worked with: [SuperStore Sales DataSet.xlsx](/SuperStore%20Sales%20DataSet.xlsx/)

# Join Tables

The dataset contains three tables: Order, Product and Customer. In order to be able to combine data from these tables 
I established relationship between them:

This will allow Tableau smartly and efficiently Join🔗 these tables together when needed.
