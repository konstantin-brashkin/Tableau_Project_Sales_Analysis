# Introduction

Hi! This is my **Tableau Portfolio Project** which involves working with SuperStore Sales🛒 Dataset.  
This project includes steps such as **Joining tables** together, **creating Calculated fields**, **creating Map chart** 🌍,
**Bar chart**📊, **Scatter plot** ● and **Line Area Chart**📈, and the final step is to combine all the visualizations into one
**Dashboard**!
